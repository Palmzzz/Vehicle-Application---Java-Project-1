My first project to become familiar with the BlueJ environment and Java

I gained experience of understanding code and building upon it
It was my first foray in to understanding client specifications
Writing code to implement the specifications requested
I also learnt how to write my own methods and call them
As well as breaking down problems in order to build a solution. 

I was able to follow the specficiation of drawing a picture of a vehicle
Using shapes for the wheel and the chasis, and being able to move the vehicle to the left and right as a whole
With the chasis and wheels moving at the same time.
